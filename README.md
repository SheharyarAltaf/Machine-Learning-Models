# Machine-Learning-Models
In this Repo we will create differnet machine learning Models using kaggle Datasets and then explore various features of our models by accuracy and precision Score.
# 1- Titanic Survival Prediction Model
**features** In This project we will predict the survival of people by given data in csv file having different features.<br>

# 2-Weather Forecasting Model:
In this project features data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, and scaling), feature engineering (creation and selection), and model training (using multiple machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning). It also includes data visualization and accurate weather forecasting based on historical data.<br>
it will predict the Tomorrow Rain in the Dataset Format (0 or 1) using differnet algorithms with accuracy score.<br><br>
